## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

In the realm of system administration, htop has long been a staple for monitoring and managing processes. Its interactive interface and comprehensive information have made it an indispensable tool for system administrators and users alike. However, as technology evolves and user expectations shift, it is time to reimagine htop for the modern era.

We propose a reinvention of htop, embracing a modern design and leveraging the power of Rust, a programming language renowned for its performance, safety, and concurrency features. Our goal is to create a process viewer that not only retains the core functionality of htop but also enhances it with a user-friendly interface, improved performance, and cross-platform compatibility.
